The hardware is full of sloppy code.
   Start standardizing and pulling up modules that abstract common functionality.
   Maybe look into generating a verilog testbench for individual units that perforns a number of tests depending on the interfaces that the unit provides.
      Should be easy, just one more template.

There are a dozens of TODOs scathered all over the codebase. Start by fixing some of them.

Generated code does not take into account parameters when it should.
   Some wires are given fixed sizes when they depend on verilog parameters.
